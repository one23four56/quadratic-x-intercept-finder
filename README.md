# quadratic-x-intercept-finder
A single page app that finds x-intercepts of quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.  
This is designed to be all in a single HTML file so it is easy to transport. It is very annoying to code when it is like that though, so the files are kept separate until a release, when they are merged and minified.
