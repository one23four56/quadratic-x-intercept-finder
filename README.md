# quadratic-x-intercept-finder
A single page app that finds x-intercepts of quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.  

The calculations are done using raw JavaScript and the rendering of the math is done with MathJax (with the math itself written in LaTeX).

This is designed to be all in a single HTML file so it is easy to transport. You can find the merged & minified version in the assets under the latest release.
